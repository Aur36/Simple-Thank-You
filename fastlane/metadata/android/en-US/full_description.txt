Having this app installed will prevent the displaying of a "Donate please" dialog. Other than that, it also allows using a Shared Theme, which means that as soon as you change a color in one app, all other apps will be updated. Newly installed apps from the suite will automagically receive the shared colors too.

It might unlock more extra features in the future. Please keep the app installed at least for a day, to avoid getting automatically refunded.
